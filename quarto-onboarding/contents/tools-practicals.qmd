## Registering Working Hours

To simplify the process, we have provided two options for registering hours: the official method, via Fusion, and the unofficial method, via an Excel sheet on Teams (Student Documents). In the Excel sheet, the actual hours are recorded, ensuring that the semester's total number of hours balances when the semester is over.

## DTU FUSION
